       Alice in Chains is, or was, cromprised of vocalist and lead guitarist Jerry Cantrell, lead vocalist Layne Staley, drummer Sean Kinney, and bassist Mike Inez. They kept this line up until 1996, when the band went on a 6 year hiatus. In 2002, Layne Staley died of a heroin overdose and the band was considered "defunct". In 2006, the band decided to reuinite, and William Duvall joined the band as the lead vocalist.

     <h2>
       Formation and History
     </h2>
       <p>
       Before Alice in Chains became Alice in Chains, most of the members had side projects going on or were involved with other bands. Eventually, the band had all of it's original members and only needed a lead singer. This is when Jerry Cantrell began making attempts to recruit Layne Staley. While at first apprehensive, Cantrell constantly auditioned terrible lead singers in front of Staley, until he eventually took the hint and joined.
